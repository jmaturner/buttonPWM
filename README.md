# buttonPWM
Written for a digispark. This uses a tip transistor, an LED and high current lithium battery. 
Two Buttons - UP,down to control LED intensity via PWM
Pushing (or holding) the down button will turn the value to zero and turn off the led (or any other load). 
The code maps an integer range to the PWM value. 
This would be best applied to any project that you want to dim and brighten
LEDs or lamps digitally (e.g a flashlight).
